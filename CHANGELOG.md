## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-19

This release prepares Valence for its first public publication under:

https://github.com/unified-field-dev/valence

### Highlights

- Publishable crates renamed to the free crates.io namespace `uf-*` (for example `uf-valence`, `uf-valence-core`) while keeping Rust import paths (`valence`, `valence_core`, …)
- Normalized repository metadata across workspace crates
- Corrected public documentation links and ownership references
- Added public community-health files and security policy
- Hardened GitHub Actions workflows (pinned actions, least-privilege permissions, package dry-run)
- Dependabot and CodeQL deferred until the repository is public / more mature
- Clarified publication intent for internal-only test and bench crates (`valence-testkit` is not published)
- Tightened hop-query test skips into an explicit capability matrix

### Notes

- `valence-testkit`, `valence-e2e`, and `valence-bench` are internal support crates and are not part of the public crates.io surface
- Wire-backend examples still require live service URLs
- Cross-backend transaction semantics remain unsupported
- Some advanced hop-query behavior remains pre-1.0; unsupported combinations are skipped explicitly rather than soft-passing

### Migration

Replace Cargo dependency names when consuming from git or crates.io:

```toml
uf-valence = { git = "https://github.com/unified-field-dev/valence", package = "uf-valence", features = ["mem"] }
```

Rust code continues to use `use valence::…` (crate `[lib] name` is unchanged).
